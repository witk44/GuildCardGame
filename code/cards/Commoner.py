When banded together with 2 other commoners a player has the ability to announce a union during their turn. Doing so allows the player to revive one card (if necessary) and all alive commoners are reshuffled for new cards. This means that if you have a dead commoner and two alive, you can get a brand-new deck! If you have two dead commoners though, only one can be revived meaning you only get two new cards. This move cannot be bluffed"

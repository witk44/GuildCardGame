        self.ability_description = "Protects a player from assassinations, marksman attempts, and thievery. When faced with one of these scenarios, a player may announce they are using a princess to protect them. The princess protects a playerâ€™s entire deck from assassination, but during a marksman attempt, it only protects the player if their opponent selects their princess to be killed. The princess also protects a player from being thieved two times. After the first time, the princess must be turned sideways, indicating it can only be used 1 more time. A sideways princess can still protect you from a marksman or an assassin. After a princess is used it is to be reshuffled into the deck for a new card."

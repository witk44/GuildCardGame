This means that if a player chooses to call out one of their opponents on one of their turns and it turns out they were being truthful, a knight can be played to protect the player who called them out and saves them from having to kill a card. When a knight is played it must be flipped over immediately and cannot be bluffed. It is reshuffled after its use and a new card must be drawn to take its place"

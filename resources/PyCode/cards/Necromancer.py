The following cards are allowed to be necromanced, Assassin, King, Queen*, Thief, Knight, Princess, Jester, Cleric*, Alchemist, and Marksman. \n *The queen and cleric can only be selected if they are dead. Players may not select queens and clerics that have been played as they are removed from the game and in a separate pile from the deck"

## Game Overview

The objective of the game is to eliminate the other player’s cards while keeping your own alive. You win by being the last person at the table with at least one card still face down.Each card has a unique ability that can be used to do many different things in the game. Developing a strategic approach as to when to use each ability will make it much easier to winss
Keep in mind that while you are developing your own strategies, your opponents are doing the same. Watch out for scenarios that might seem “too good to be true” because they might just be!

## Gameplay
During a turn, players can choose to do one of the following actions:

Collect 1 gold from the center and add it to their stash. This is called a “pocket”

Play one of the cards in their hand and activate its ability. Some cards cost gold to use so be mindful of this before playing your turn

Players may also bluff and use any card ability even if they don’t actually have the card they are attempting to use. (Ex. Playing a commoner as a merchant to get a new card) 

Bluffing cards can be a great way to gain an advantage against your opponents but it also comes with a big risk. Getting caught bluffing will result in you losing a card. (See challenges tab)

Finally, players may choose to “execute” one of their opponents. This move does not require a specific card and can be played during a player’s turn to eliminate an opponent’s card. 

This move costs 12 gold, which should be placed in the center of the table after the player has announced which of their opponents they are going to “execute”

The player who is selected to be “executed” then must choose which of their cards they want to eliminate and flip it face up. The player being “executed” chooses the card they are going to eliminate from their hand. The player doing the “execution” does not get to choose

The only way to stop an “execution” is for the player chosen to be “executed” to play a Cleric. This card cannot be bluffed and must be flipped face-up immediately when being played. This card has the ability to block 1 “execution” during the game before it is removed from the deck after being played. (See Cleric card info)

After playing a cleric, the “executioner” must still pay the 12 gold. The person who played the Cleirc must place it face up, next to the deck of cards, signaling that it is removed from the game and cannot be played again. The player then grabs a new card to replace the Cleric they just used, and the game resumes

After one of these moves is played, the player’s turn is now over and the game continues on to the next person. 

Players may not do more than one action during their turn

Players must do something with their turn and cannot choose to skip or do nothing

The maximum amount of gold a player can have in their stash is 20. Going above this number is considered cheating and will result in an immediate loss for the player

Some cards can only be used once, before being shuffled back into the deck. In the event that one of these types of cards is played, the player must make sure to grab a new card to replace the one they just used

In the event that a player goes out of turn, or accidentally reveals one of their cards, they may not reshuffle and must continue the game as normal. 

This also applies when a player is short on gold when attempting to pay for an action. Be careful as messing these up give the rest of the players in the game valuable information about your hand. 

Some cards in the game can only be used so many times in a row before they go on cooldown. Failure to abide by the cooldowns can result in a penalty such as killing a card or losing a turn. 

Repeated offenses to this rule result in an immediate loss of the game for the player. (See card abilities for cooldowns)

Bluffing cards is the only form of “cheating” in the game that is permitted. Stealing gold from the middle, switching the order of your cards, looking at another player’s cards, and breaking the rules in any way to gain an advantage will result in an immediate loss for the player

When playing a card during their turn, players do not need to point to which card they are using unless specifically asked to by another player during that turn. This does not include cards that need to be shuffled after their use, instead players must slide their card forward while announcing their move, wait a few seconds, and then put their card into the bottom of the deck before performing its action.

When using a card during your turn, players may ask you to clarify which one of your cards it is, requiring you to point to the card you are using

If a player has the card they are claiming to play in their hand when asked they are allowed to point to any of their 3 cards. If they decide to point to one of their cards that is not the real one, they must face the consequences of whatever follows after they point to that card. 

This means that if they get challenged on this move, they must flip the card they pointed to, not the truthful one

An example of this would be if a player had a king in their left slot, but when asked during their turn where their king was, they point to the right. In this scenario they are not allowed to flip the true king, they must flip the card they pointed to instead, as this situation gets treated like a bluff

Players do not need to answer questions like “Which one is your King again?” if they are not currently using that card during their turn

When bluffing a card that needs to be shuffled after its use, players must pick a card from their deck to be the alleged card they are bluffing, and treat it the same as the real card. This means that it will be shuffled and a new card will be drawn to replace it

Learning how to shuffle your deck without cards that allow you to can be very beneficial to your game. It is hard to track someones hand that is always changing

A player’s hand must stay in the same order they chose at the beginning for the duration of the game. This means that you are not allowed to move your cards around at any point during the game. This does not mean you need to keep the same cards for the whole game though

For example, when you play a card that has an ability that is a one-time use, it requires you to shuffle it and take a new card. This new card should go into the same slot that the old one came from, to keep the order the same. 

As the game plays out, your opponents will begin to collect information from your moves as to what card might be where in your hand. When players learn what cards you have it can be devastating for your longevity in the game, so it is important to be mindful of this while playing

When playing a turn there is a certain amount of time your turn should take.

Going too slow is not allowed, and you can be called out by other players and possibly penalized for holding up the flow of the game.

Going too fast is also not allowed. You must make sure that you give your opponents enough time to process your move and decide if they want to challenge you or not. (See challenges) Rushing your turn to get away with a bluff is considered cheating.

A good rule of thumb is to announce your move, wait about 3-5 seconds, and then play your move. There is no specific time, and players should use their judgment to determine what speed they want to enforce

Depending on the number of players (3-8), the deck size will change. This makes the card counter sheet a very important tool. You must refer to it when creating the deck for whatever number of players you are choosing to play with, as these numbers are very important.

When deciding whether or not to challenge a player is when the card counter sheet can be used to its full potential. In a 4 person deck, there are only 3 Thieves, so if you have one and there are two face up on the table, you know that the player trying to currently use one is lying. Make sure you take a look at this sheet anytime you have the suspicion someone is bluffing because the numbers don’t lie!
